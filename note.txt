the supreme coder said that in order to access the logs, one must use the same TCP and IP fields as the people who posted the logs. Apparently, that's how the Zionists (Khat be upon them) who control the media designed the TCP protocol. praise the Khat, for he made the infidels fools.
due to that, use the client adapter we gave you to ask for logs. It was designed to match the server prototype.

In other matters, I was told a capture file of part of the main server maintenance was uploaded to the secret repository too, analyze it to see that the server works well with the new TLS protocol and report back.

note: the client adapter is TOP SECRET. it will not appear anywhere on the internet.

P.S. Khat to USRael, Khat to CHINA, and praise be the Khat!
